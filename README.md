# Upgrade a local Evmos node

This utility helps executing the necessary commands to prepare a
software upgrade proposal, submit it to a running local Evmos node,
and vote on the proposal.

Note, that this script is designed to work with a local node that was 
started by calling the `local_node.sh` script from the Evmos main repository.
